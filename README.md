# LibreAllHouse
Use Raspberry pi devices to have all house coverage using the miaomiao device.

The data that the receivers will read should be understood by xDrip.
Currently, one needs to use a special version, based on https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/pull/418

More instructions on installation of the pis can be found here:
